# PROGRAMMING _WITH_JAVASCRIPT 

## Duckett: HTML & CSS, Chapter 1 - Structure 

*What is Script?* " A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal." 

When writing a script you need to make a goal and then list tasks that need to be completed. You can use these steps recommended in Duckett page 17 to break down your goal into smaller parts. 
- Step one: Define the goal 
    - You need to define the task you want to accomplish or the computer to solve. 
- Step two: Design the script
    - Make a plan or list of things that need to be completed in order. 
- Step three: code each step 
    - Start coding straight away. This is the important part.
