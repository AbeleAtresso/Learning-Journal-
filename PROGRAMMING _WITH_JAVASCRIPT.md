*What is Script?* " A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal." 

When writing a script you need to make a goal and then list tasks that need to be completed. You can use these steps recommended in Duckett page 17 to break down your goal into smaller parts. 
- Step one: Define the goal 
    - You need to define the task you want to accomplish or the computer to solve. 
- Step two: Design the script
    - Make a plan or list of things that need to be completed in order. 
- Step three: code each step 
    - Start coding straight away. This is the important part.

#### Expressions 
- An expression evaluates into a single value. 
- Types of expressions are expressions that just assign a value to a variable or expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

#### Operators 
- Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- Arithmetic Operators are +, -, /, *, ++, --, and %. More than one arithmetic operators can be used in one expression. For example: `total = 2 + 5 * 10;` and the total will be 52. 
- The string operator is one string operator, the + symbol.  It is used to join two strings. We have seen this before in class 6 lab. For example: ` var welcomeMessage = greeting + name + ‘!’: ` 
    - You can mix numbers and strings together for example: 
    ` var cost1 = '7';`
     `var cost2 = '9';` 
     `var total = cost1 + cost2;` 
The string will say `'79'`

#### What is a function? 

Functions allow you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. This is useful when you have a repeating task. You can use your the function instead of repeating the same set of statements. 
- The expressions are placed inside `{}`
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value. 
- Pieces of information passed to a function are `parameters`. 
- You can declare a function by using the keyword `function`. Then you give the function a new by using the identifier followed by `()`. 
    Example: 
     
       function sayHello() {
          document.write('Hello!');
        }

- Example for returning a value: 
   
    `function getArea(width, height) {
      return width * height;
    }`
  
   The width and height are parameters.
