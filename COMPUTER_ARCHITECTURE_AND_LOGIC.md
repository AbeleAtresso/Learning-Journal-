## COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE AND LOGIC

My top three most significant learning form the [6 Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx_6-wdslM&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) are 
    - What all computers do 
    - How computers work
    - Hardware and Software

#### What all computers do
All computers take input, store the information, process it and output the results. These four parts make a computer, a computer. Fun fact, computers started out as basic calculators. 

#### How computers work
- Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer. 
- `Bit` is the smallest piece of information a computer can store.  A single 1 or 0 is a bit and 8 bits are called a byte.  
- Bianary digit system use 1s and 0s. 
- CPU is master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. 

#### Hardware and Software
- Hardwares are things like the circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, etc.. of a computer. 
- Softerwares are codes like games, websites, maps, analysis, and apps. 
- Operating system is the master program that manges how a software uses the hardware.
