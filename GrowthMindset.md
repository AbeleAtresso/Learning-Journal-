# Growth Mindset

A *growth mindset* is peopleâ€™s belief that their skills and knowledge can be improved with hard work and resilience. A growth mindset leads to success in life. I can keep myself in a growth mindset by doing the following:

- Acknowledging and embrace imperfections. 
- Viewing challenges as opportunities. 
- Valuing the process over the end result.
