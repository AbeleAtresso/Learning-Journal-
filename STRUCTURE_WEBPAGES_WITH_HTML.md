# Structure Webpages with HTML 

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a programming language that defines the structure of the website's body.  
- Tags tell the browser what the content is and how to display it. 
- There are opening and closing tags. Some tags don't need a closing, because they are self-closing. 
- Content is displayed in blocks or boxes.
- examples of tags: 
    - paragraph text `<p>....</p>`
    - headlines `<h1>....</h>` 
    - Navigation `<nav>...</nav>`
